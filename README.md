<b>THE PROJECT</b><br>
We want to build the database of all the customable Tux, which respects the current (2019) graphical charter in 2D, 3D and Motion Design. 
<br>
<b>ABOUT TUX</b><br>
Tux is the Linux mascot, originally drawn as raster image by Larry Ewing in 1996, according to Linus Torvalds's idea.

<br>
<b>RELEASES</b><br>
Every file must respect a strict graphical charter, defined by the first release of the repository "Tux-Original". 
Each element must be drawn in its own layer, in order to give the user the opportunity to modify the penguin’s accessories and colors.
<br>
<b>TOOLS</b><br>
Poggo releases its 2D vector creations through .SVG INKSCAPE, its 3D creations through BLENDER files.
<br>
<b>COMMUNITY</b><br>
Every designer can submit a creation, Poggo will check that the requirements are respected.
