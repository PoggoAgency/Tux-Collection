Tux is the Linux mascot, originally drawn as raster image by Larry Ewing in 1996, according to Linus Torvalds's idea.<br>

<b>RELEASES</b><br>
Every file must respect a strict graphical charter, defined by the first release of the repository "Tux-Original".<br> 
Each element must be drawn in its own layer, in order to give the user the opportunity to modify the penguin’s accessories and colors.<br>

Poggo releases its 2D vector creations through .SVG INKSCAPE, its 3D creations through BLENDER files.<br>
